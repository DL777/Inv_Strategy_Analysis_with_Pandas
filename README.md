# Investment Strategy Analysis with Pandas
The purpose of this project is to create a tool (Jupyter notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios such as returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios and determines the best performing portfolio.

I worked with historical daily returns of several portfolios: some are theoretical algorithmic trading portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. I then used this analysis to demonstrate how to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P TSX 60 Index).
